# Pokedex 

● Design / Create a web application, using the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/), that consists of: 
    
    ○ A homepage - which would include:      
        ■ A search bar - that allows a user to search for a Pokemon. 
        ■ A random Pokemon card below the search bar which would change on a daily basis for every user but not on every refresh.
    ○ A search results pages - with list of Pokemon that would match the user search. 
    ○ A details page - that would display all the attributes associated with the Pokemon. 



Check if Node is installed on the system. If not install Node in your system.

In the project directory, you can run:g

### `npm install`

Installs all the packages required by the APP

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm install -g serve`

This package will install a global level serve which will help to create a static server to host the app.

### `serve -s build -l 5000`

This will create a Static Server. Runs the app in the production mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
